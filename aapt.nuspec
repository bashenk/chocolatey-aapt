<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!-- Test your packages in a test environment: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces 
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements 
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <summary>Android Asset Packaging Tool</summary>
    <description>AAPT (Android Asset Packaging Tool) is a build tool that Android Studio and Android Gradle Plugin use to compile and package your app’s resources. AAPT parses, indexes, and compiles the resources into a binary format that is optimized for the Android platform.

See https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/aapt2 or https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/build-tools

## Please Note

This is an automatically updating package. It will download the latest build-tools from dl.google.com/android/repository/build-tools_r`version`-windows.zip and extract aapt.exe. You can find all available versions at https://dl.google.com/android/repository/repository2-1.xml.
If you find there is an update available, reinstall using `choco install aapt --force` and please contact the maintainer(s) to let them know the package is updated so that a new version number can be pushed.

## Package Parameters

`/Channel:['stable'|'beta'|'dev'|'canary']` - Specify from which channel to download. Default = stable. If nonexistant, null, or whitespace, this will download the latest full release.
Example: `choco install aapt2 --params '/Channel:beta'`
